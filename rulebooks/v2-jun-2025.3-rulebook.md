## Crisis Allocation Logic (Annex Reference)

Gold (`SGLN`) may be added to the portfolio up to 10% in the following scenarios:

- GBP/USD breaks below 1.20
- Major systemic crisis detected (e.g. global credit event, inflation > 6%)
- Global bond yields rise > 200 bps with simultaneous equity drawdown > 20%

*All triggers governed by the upcoming Trigger Logic Annex v1.0*

---

## Rebalancing Policy

- Rebalancing occurs during Yearly Reviews unless a tactical trigger forces an earlier change
- No automatic dividend reinvestment assumed (but accumulating share classes used where possible)

---
